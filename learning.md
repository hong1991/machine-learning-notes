**Learning** or **training** a [[supervised learning]] model means attempting to find parameters $\phi$ that make sensible output predictions from the input. We learn these parameters using a [[training dataset]]. Quanity the degreee of mismatch in the mapping with the **loss** $L$, or the [[loss function]].
When we train the model, we are seeking parameters $\hat{\phi}$ that minimize the [[loss function]].
